Etude3 Arithmetic.py, Author: Cedric Stephani

For this etude I made the assumption based on what I was told that once the input was deemed larger than the target answer I could stop running the branches of that particular sub-tree, e.g. there would be no 0 in the input. I believe the speed of the program is now sufficient with the testing I have done. I have also not added too many error checks as I was told this was not needed for this etude and
that wrong input would not be provided.

run the code with: python Arithmetic.py
